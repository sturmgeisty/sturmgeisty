## Hey :wave:! I'm sturmgeisty!

### :rocket: Introduction

You may be familiar with my username from various projects created throughout my coding journey which resided in the communities i've been in:

- creating free and useful addons for projects
- useful modifications or addons for games such as: Roblox, Minecraft 
- various open-source projects I've released or contributed to

Throughout my programming experience since 2019-2020, I've taken immense pride in the countless hours dedicated to crafting software that has brought joy to people using it.

<sub>*If you've had the opportunity to utilize any project I've created, you've probably helped me fix vulnerabilities and I thank you for that!*</sub>

### :dart: Current Focus

Wishing for my roblox game studio to become big, working hard everyday.
